\section{Fourth Member}
This is the section dedicated to one of the team members, and it should be written individually . It can include a range of things; first subsection is a space for you to point out the strengths and weaknesses of the module, including complaints about the module coordinator Max Wilson. The second section should have a selfie image with Max! The last part of it is the most important one. You will need to write a paragraph about what you have learned in this module. You can write it in \textbf{Bold} if you want or you can use other fonts. 

Please do not forget:
\begin{itemize}
	\item First paragraph should have your comments about the module
	\item Second one, a selfie img with Max
	\item Last one, what you learned in this module.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comments about the module}
The labs have quickly become the best part of the module, since they give us a chance to put what we have learnt into practice. It is also helpful to know that what we are studying is applicable and even essential to the real world of software engineering. 
The module is well taught and Max provides us with lots of resources.

\subsection{Selfie with Max}

\end{figure}

%You can then use the label of the figure to reference it later with the command ${\backslash}ref$. you can comment out the next line to see an example of how it works.

% My selfie with Max is in  Figure~\ref{fig:selfie}.

\subsection{What I have learned in this module}
I have learned that the successful development of a system does not require solely on the quality of code written but also the foundation on which it was built; such as whether it has been planned properly, meets the requirements of the stakeholders and has been tested effectively. This is especially essential because the cost of making changes to code increases exponentially with development.
